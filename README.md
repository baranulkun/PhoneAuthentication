# Phone Authentication | Kotlin
 A simple number validation application written in Kotlin. It includes a basic user interface for input, followed by a number entry screen. It imposes restrictions on the user to enter numbers in specific formats. After the number is validated for the last time, it sends an SMS to the user and makes the validation section visible. A symbolic and non-functional waiting period has been added for sending SMS again. This waiting period should be managed with Firebase or the necessary information should be stored in an independent class. It establishes an API connection between Firebase and Google, and performs the required queries
